# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Customers can manage every aspect of their Revenium account from the terminal with a tool that's both beautiful and scriptable.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Scaffold & Config

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Project Scaffold & Config)
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-12 — Completed plan 01-02

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Prove CRUD pattern with Sources first (Phase 3), then replicate across all resources
- Roadmap: Separate output layer (Phase 2) from scaffold so table/JSON rendering is reusable before any resource work
- Roadmap: Metrics separated from CRUD resources due to different query patterns (time ranges, aggregations)
- [Phase 01]: configDirOverride pattern for test isolation instead of interface injection
- [Phase 01]: API client uses Do(ctx, method, path, body, result) pattern for all HTTP calls
- [Phase 01]: PersistentPreRunE skips config loading for version and config commands
- [Phase 01]: cmd/config uses internalconfig import alias to avoid conflict with internal/config

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API response shapes need to be discovered from OpenAPI spec during implementation
- Pagination pattern unknown -- verify during Phase 3 (Sources)
